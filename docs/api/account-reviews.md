### How to ensure that your account review is successful?

To ensure that your account review is successful, follow these tips when submitting your application.

Make sure to provide accurate and detailed information about your store and the products you intend to sell.
We work with a variety of digital products, including software & SaaS, templates, eBooks, PDFs, code, icons, fonts, design assets, photos, videos, audio, and premium access such as Discord servers, GitHub repositories, and subscription-based courses.

Alternatively, you can use our APIs to grant immediate access to digital assets, services, or software for customers with one-time purchases or subscriptions.

We meticulously review every store application to ensure there is no deceptive content, such as

* Unearned badges (e.g. Product Hunt)
* False customer testimonials
* Misleading reviews or number of users

We do not allow anything that is unfair, deceptive, abusive, harmful, or shady.
If you are unsure whether your use case would be approved, please reach out to us in advance for clarification.

### Why do you need to review my account?

We review accounts to ensure that they are legitimate and in compliance with our terms of service.
This helps us prevent fraud, misuse, malicious activities, and high-risk accounts.

We need to perform these reviews to protect our users and ensure a safe and secure platform for all. Combined with meeting our own KYC/AML requirements as a billing platform.

### On-going monitoring

We continuously monitor all accounts to ensure that they are in compliance with our terms of service and to proactively prevent fraud.
If we notice any suspicious activity, we will review the account again.

In addition to performing these reviews, we also perform random audits of accounts to ensure that they are in compliance with our terms of service. These reviews are often completed within hours and without any additional information required from you.

We look at:

* The product and its description
* The pricing and payment methods
* The customer support and contact information
* The website and landing page
* Risk scores across historic transactions
* Refund & Chargeback ratio
