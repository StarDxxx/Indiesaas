## Overview

Product Bundles are a powerful feature in Creem that allows you to group related products together. Similar to what other platforms call "Variants", Product Bundles help you organize your offerings in a structured and customer-friendly way.

## Creating and Managing Bundles

### Create a New Bundle

Creating product bundles in Creem is extremely easy and can be done directly through the dashboard.

### Creating a Product Bundle

You can create product bundles by navigating to the products page and clicking on the bundles tab, or by navigating directly to [https://www.creem.io/dashboard/products/bundles](https://www.creem.io/dashboard/products/bundles)

When creating a new product bundle, you simply need to select which products should be part of it from the dropdown menu. This intuitive interface makes it easy to group related products together and create tiered offerings.

During bundle creation, you'll find two important toggles that enhance customer experience:

1. **Enable Self-Service Upgrades/Downgrades**: When enabled, customers can independently upgrade or downgrade between products within this bundle through the Customer Portal. This empowers customers to manage their subscriptions without requiring merchant intervention.

2. **Enable Upsells at Checkout**: When enabled, customers will see upgrade options for higher-tier products within the bundle during checkout. If this toggle is activated, the checkout description will display the product bundle description rather than the individual product description, providing a more cohesive presentation of your tiered offerings.

These options give you flexibility in how customers interact with your product tiers and can significantly improve conversion rates through strategic upsell opportunities.
